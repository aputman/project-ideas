## The user and a language
Let's say that you have a smartphone which you need to have different 
volumes and types or ringtone at different time of the day and week. 
Its annoying to have to remember and change it everytime you need to. 
This language would allow you to define when and how to change your
phones ringtone and volume throughout the week with the highest level
of autonomy. 


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

This language is needed by people who have a hard time remembering 
to turn their phone off for class, or back on in the evening when they
are expecting calls or text messages. This is helping people with busy
schedules that don't necessarily think about their phone while they
are transistioning from task to task. 

This persons experience right now is that they don't think about their
phone when changing tasks, so when they go into an important meeting
or class, they forget that they have their phone on. And if they don't
then they annoyingly have to go in and manually change the settings 
every couple hours or so. 

The best case is that we would want the users to forget about their phones.
I would want the user to be able to sync their calendar of choice with 
this phone app and set a series of conditions and results for when during
the day or during certain calendar events to change the ringtone and
volume of their phone. The calendar should sync automatically, so they
should only need to interact with the app when they want to change a rule. 

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

A DSL is appropriate as it gives the user customization as to how they
want their ringtone to change to their schedule. It will automate their
manually done process of changing it every few hours.


### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

One of the people I interviewed during class that one day inspired me to
create this idea. He was having problems liking his phone since it wasn't 
easy to silence it at certain points throughout the day automatically. 

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Phone ringtone volume automator scheduler 

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 

The user would first interact with it by optionally linking a calendar to
their profile. They would then set a series of conditions and actions that
detail how they want their ringtone to change through their schedule and day.

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

The program will passively run 24/7 changing the ringtone and volume of the 
phone as dictated by the rules in the interface. There shouldn't be errors
that occur, but maybe the user might have overlapping times and doesn't understand
how that works. They would realize a problem when they didn't hear what they
expected and change the interface based on that. 

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be easy to set rules based off of times and calendars for when
to change your phone ringtone and volume. It shouldn't be possible to do 
anything else. It also shouldn't be possible to overlap static time rules. 

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

There are several others apps that do similar things but they don't sync with
calendars and allow users to define rules to react to the calendar.

## The Project
This might not be the best project since it would require a lot of overhead of 
designing an app. Designing the app itself would take up most of the time 
of the project. 


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

I would say 90% of the time would be working on the system to parse calendar
data and design the interface for the app. 


### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

I would say this project is decently ambitious as it wasn't defined what type of 
calendars it is able to sync with or what phones it would be compatable with. 
So it could take dozens of calendar types and support all 3 types of phone OSs. 

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_

This would be a good idea since it wouldn't be too hard to find users to test on
and probably a lot that would be interested in using it. It would be a bad idea
because of the scope and the fact that there are already so many ringtone time 
setters out there on the market.
